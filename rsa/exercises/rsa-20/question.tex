  Is $2$ a Fermat witness for $F_{14} = 2^{2^{14}} + 1$?
  What about $3$?
  Can you find a divisor of $F_{14}$?
  The fact that $F_{14}$ is composite was first discovered in 1961.
  It took 50 years before a nontrivial 54-digit divisor of $F_{14}$,
  116928085873074369829035993834596371340386703423373313,
  was found.
  See \url{https://t5k.org/mersenne/LukeMirror/lit/lit_039s.htm}.
  I think the complete factorization of $F_{14}$ is still unknown.
