  Let $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$.
  These numbers are called \defone{Fermat numbers} (not Fibonacci numbers).
  For $n = 5$, $F_5 = 2^{2^5} + 1 = 4294967297$.
  Fermat thought $F_5$ is prime, but it is not.
  (The first 5 Fermat numbers $F_0, F_1, ..., F_4$ are prime.)
  Euler was the first to realize that $F_5$ is not prime.
  Of course neither Fermat nor Euler had computers.
  Prove that $F_5$ is not a prime in two ways:
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item[(a)] Find the smallest Fermat witness for $F_5$.
    \item[(b)] Find a prime divisor of $F_5$ by brute force division.
  \end{enumerate}
