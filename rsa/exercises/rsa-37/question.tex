  Implement brute force trial-by-division until $\sqrt{n}$ for $n$
  to find a factor of $n$.
  Compare the runtimes for this algorithm
  against your implementation of Fermat factorization above.
  Which one is faster?
  Remember that brute force performs $\floor{\sqrt{n}}$ mods in the worse case scenario.
