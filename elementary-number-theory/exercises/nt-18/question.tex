  Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p + 2$ is also a prime?
  If $p$ and $p + 2$ are both primes, then they are called \defone{twin primes}.
  The \defone{twin prime conjecture} states that there are infinitely many
  twin primes.
  (See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime}.)
  Write a program that prints $p,p+2$ if both are primes.
  Print the time elapsed between the discovery of pairs of twin primes.
