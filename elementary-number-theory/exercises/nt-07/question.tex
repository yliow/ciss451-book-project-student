  Compute the following.
  You should go as far as you can.
  In other words, either you can a fixed integer (such as $1$) or
  derive $\gcd(\alpha, \beta)$ where $\alpha, \beta$ are
  as simple as possible.
  For instance, to simplify $\gcd(3 + 2a, a)$, since $3 + 2a = 2 \cdot a + 3$,
  by the GCD Lemma, we have
  \[
  \gcd(3 + 2a, a) = \gcd(a, 3)
  \]
  In the following $a, b, x, n \in \Z$ are positive integers.
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=\textnormal{(\alph*)}]
  \item $\gcd(ab, b)$
  \item $\gcd(a, a + 1)$
  \item $\gcd(ab + a, b)$ where $0 < a < b$
  \item $\gcd(a(a+1) + a, (a+1))$ where $0 < a < b$
  \item $\gcd(1 + x + \cdots + x^n, x)$
  \item $\gcd(F_{10}, F_{11})$ where $F_n$ is the $n$--th Fibonacci number.
    (Recall: $F_0 = 1, F_1 = 1, F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_n$ for $n \geq 0$.)
  \end{enumerate}
