  (This \lq\lq idle'' problem is way more important than you think.)
  \begin{myenum}
  \item 
    Compute
    \[
      2^n \pmod{26}
    \]
    for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.
    What do you notice?
    Can you tell me what is
    \[
      2^{1000} \pmod{26}
    \]
  \item
    Now try $3^n \pmod{26}$
    for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.
    Can you tell me what is $3^{1000} \pmod{26}$
  \item  Now try
    $4^n \pmod{26}$
    for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.
    Can you tell me what is
    $4^{1000} \pmod{26}$
  \item Now try
    $5^n \pmod{26}$
    for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.
    Can you tell me what is
    $5^{1000} \pmod{26}$
  \item Of course since $\Z/26$ is finite, you would expect
    $a^n \pmod{26}$ to be finite even though $n=0,1,2,...$
    runs through an infinite set.
    Which $a$ would give you most distinct value
    of $a^n \pmod{26}$ as you
    run through all values for $n$?
    And do you notice a pattern in the finite collection of
    all the $a^n \pmod{26}$?
  \end{myenum}
