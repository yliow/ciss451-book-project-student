Let
$x = \langle x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \rangle$
$y = \langle y_1, y_2, ..., y_n \rangle$
be two sequences of real numbers.
Let
\[
\lVert x \rVert = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2}
\]
and likewise for $\lVert y \rVert$.
Also, let
\[
x \cdot y = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i
\]
Note that
\[
x \cdot x = \lVert x \rVert^2
\]
\begin{myenum}
\item Show that
\[
|x \cdot y| \leq  \lVert x \rVert \cdot \lVert y \rVert
\]
and equality holds iff $y = cx = \langle cx_1, ..., cx_n \rangle$ for some
$c \in \R$.
\item
In particular if $x$ is made up of real numbers $\geq 0$ which
are not all zeros and not all the same and $y$ is a permutation of $x$, then
$x \cdot y$ is maximum iff $y = x$
(i.e., the permutation used to create $y$ is the identity permutation
that does not move the values of $x$).
\end{myenum}
The above        is the justification of the method used in breaking
Vigen\`ere's cipher.
