  \item In $S_5$, let
  $\tau = (2 \ 3 \ 5)$.
  $\tau$ is a function mapping $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ to $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
  What is $\tau(1)$? What is $\tau(5)$?
  \item In $S_5$, let
  $\sigma = (1 \ 4 \ 3)(2 \ 5)$ and
  $\tau = (2 \ 3 \ 5)$.
  What is $\sigma \circ \tau$ (written in cycle notation)?
  \item Draw the group table of $S_3$.
  \item Show that $S_3$ is non-abelian.
