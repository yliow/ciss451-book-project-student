But wait! $a$ is not arbitrary! Remember that $a$ must be invertible
in mod 26. Recall that this means there is some integer $c$ such
that $ac \equiv 1 \,\,\,(\operatorname{mod} 26)$. Therefore it would
be helpful if you have a function that will determine if $a$ is
invertible mod 26. How would you do that?
