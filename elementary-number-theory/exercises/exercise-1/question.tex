\item Simplify $100 \pmod{26}$.
\item If you have very simple calculator with $+$, $-$, $*$, $/$
how would simplify
$131246845 \pmod{26}$? You have 10 seconds ... the clock is ticking ...
\item Simplify $33 \pmod{26}$.
\item Solve $2x + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{26}$ by brute force. Use Python or C\texttt{++}.
\item Solve $10x+20 \equiv 4x+78 \pmod{26}$ by brute force. Use Python or C\texttt{++}.
\item Simplify $10x + 20 \equiv 4x + 78 \pmod{26}$ first,
and then solve it by brute
 force. Do you get the same results as in the previous part?
\item Solve $42x^5 + 10x + 1 \equiv 73 \pmod{3}$.
\item Solve $(1000000x + 2)^3 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.
