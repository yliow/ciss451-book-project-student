  Solve
  \[
    3x = 13
  \]
  in $\Z$. Of course you can't! Now solve
  \[
    3x = 13
  \]
  in $\Q$. Of course you can!
  Do you realize that you solved it using the multiplicative inverse of $3$ in $\Q$?
  What about
  \[
    3x \equiv 13 \pmod{26}
  \]
  Are you going to use brute force and try all values (mod 26)?
  (HINT: You had better not.)
