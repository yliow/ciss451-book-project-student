  Let $X$ be a set.
  Consider $P(X)$ the powerset of $X$.
  Is is possible to make $P(X)$ into a group? If your answer is yes, then
  (of course) make sure you define a group operation,
  state the identity, and prove that the group axioms are
  satisfied. Is your group $P(X)$ abelian?
  It's even better if you can find as many group laws as you can.
