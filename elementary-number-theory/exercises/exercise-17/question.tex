  Continuing the previous question ...
    What about $a^n \pmod{p}$ when $p$ is a prime?
    How many values do you get as you run through $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$?
    First try it for $a = 2$: try about 20 to 50 primes $p$.
    Do you see a pattern? 
    Once you have spotted the pattern, try $a = 3$, etc.
(The above is a very serious research problem for you.)
