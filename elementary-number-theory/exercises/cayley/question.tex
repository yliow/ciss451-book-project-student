Every group is a subgroup of some symmetric group, i.e.,
every group is a permutation group.
In particular if $G = (G, *, e)$ is a group, then $G$ is
isomorphic to a subgroup of $\Sym(G)$.
Specifically the map $L: G \rightarrow \Sym(G)$ where
\[
L_a(x) = a * x
\]
is a 1--1 group homomorphism.
(Recall that $L_a$ is usually called the \defone{left translation} by $a \in G$.)
