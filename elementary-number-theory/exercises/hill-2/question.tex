  The following refers to matrices with $\R$ values.
  Let $M$ be a 2-by-2 matrix.
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]

    \item Is every matrix invertible?

    \item Prove that if $M$ is a 2-by-2 matrix,
    \[
    MM^{-1} = I = M^{-1}M
    \]

    \item Prove that if $M$ is a 2-by-2 matrix,
    Prove that
    \[
    IM = M = MI
    \]

    \item Prove that if $v$ is a 2-by-1 matrix,
    \[
    Iv = v
    \]

    \qed
  \end{enumerate}
