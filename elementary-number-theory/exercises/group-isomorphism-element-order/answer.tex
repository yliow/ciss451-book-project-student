Suppose $x$ has finite order and $n = |x|$.
Then $f(x)^n = f(x^n) = f(e) = e'$ where $e'$ is the identity element of $G'$.
Hence $y$ has order $\leq n$.
If $y$ has order $m$ and $m < n$, then $y^m = e'$
and $f(x^m) = f(x)^m = y^m = e' = f(e)$.
Therefore $x^m = e$ which contradicts the fact that $|x| = n$ and $m < n$.
Hence $|y| = n = |x|$.

Now suppose that $|x| = \infty$.
Then $|y|$ is also $\infty$.
Otherwise $|y| = m < \infty$ and we have
$y^m = e'$.
From the same computation as above,
$f(x^m) = f(x)^m = y^m = e' = f(e)$,
which implies that $x$ has finite order.
This is a contradiction.
Hence $|y| = \infty$.
