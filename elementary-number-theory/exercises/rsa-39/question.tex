  Suppose $z^2$ is an integer square that is the largest integer square that is $\leq$ to $x^2 - n$.
  For instance if $x^2 - n$ is $26$, then $z^2$ is $25$ (i.e., $z$ is 5).
  In other words $z^2$ is the square that is closest to $x^2 - n$ on the left.
  Note $z^2$ will be $x^2 - n$ if $x^2 - n$ is a square.
  How would you compute the the square closest to $(x + 1)^2 - n$ on the left?
  Is it $(z + 1)^2$? $(z + 2)^2$?
  If you can prove, for instance, that it's $(z + 2)^2$? then we can save
  on taking square root, correct?
  You can assume that you have the values of $x$ and $z$ and $n$.
