  Leetcode 920.\\
  \url{https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists}\\
  Your music player contains n different songs.
  You want to listen to goal songs (not necessarily different) during your trip.
  To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \li Every song is played at least once.
    \li A song can only be played again only if k other songs have been played.
  \end{enumerate}
  Given \verb!n!, \verb!goal!, and \verb!k!,
  return the number of possible playlists that you can create.
  Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $109 + 7$.
