Now let's abstract the above. Suppose $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are
numbers and $a$ and $b$ satisfy the equations
\begin{align*}
 Aa + b &= B \\
 Ca + b &= D \\
\end{align*}
Solve for $a$ and $b$ in terms for $A, B, C, D$. If this can be
done, then of course you can write a C\texttt{++} function to return $a$
and $b$ directly.
