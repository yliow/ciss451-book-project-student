  Leetcode 1071 \\
  \url{https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/} \\
  For two strings $s$ and $t$, we say
  \lq\lq $t$ divides $s$" if and only if $s = t + \cdots + t$
  (i.e., $t$ is concatenated with itself one or more times).
  Given two strings \verb!str1! and \verb!str2!, return the largest string
  \verb!x! such that \verb!x! divides both \verb!str1! and \verb!str2!.
