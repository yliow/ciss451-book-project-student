  Let $(A, +, 0)$ be an abelian group.
  Let $A[X]$ the set of polynomials with
  coefficients in $A$.
  Define a $+$ for $A[X]$ (in the obvious way), so that $A[X]$ is a group.
  State clearly the elements of $A[X]$, the $+$ on $A[X]$,
  and the identity element of $A[X]$ before proving $A[X]$ is a group.
  If $A[X]$ abelian?
  In particular the following are abelian groups:
  \begin{myenum}
  \item $(\Z[X], +, 0)$
  \item $(\Q[X], +, 0)$
  \item $(\R[X], +, 0)$
  \item $(\C[X], +, 0)$
  \item $((\Z/N)[X], +, 0)$ where $N > 1$ is an integer.  
  \end{myenum}
  Can $A[X]$ be a group if $A$ is non-abelian?
  And if so, is it abelian?
