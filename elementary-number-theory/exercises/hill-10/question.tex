  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item
    What is the size of the key space assuming the matrix is $2$-by-$2$? (I mean
    for mod 26 of course.)
    This means: how many invertible mod 26 matrices are there?
    Or: What is $|\operatorname{GL}_2(\Z/26)|$?
    You can write down a few invertible mod 26 matrices.
    But after a while you might want to
    write a program.

  \item
    See if you can find a plausible formula for the case of
    $n = 2$. The formula involves 2 and 13 because
    $26 = 2 \times 13$ and because $n = 2$.
    (Yes, there's a formula.)
    It also works if mod 26 is replaced by mod $N$ for any positive
    integer $N \geq 1$. You can try to work with matrices with values in
    $\Z/5$ then $\Z/8$, etc. and see if you can find a formula for
    $|\operatorname{GL}_2(\Z/N)|$.
    (The formula works when $n$ is any integer $\geq 1$. But you would
    need to know about matrices of size larger than 2-by-2.)
