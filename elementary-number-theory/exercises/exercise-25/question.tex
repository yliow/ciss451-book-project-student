  Notice that earlier on, we wrote down multiplicative inverses of
  elements in $\Z/26$. Some elements do not have inverses.
  Can you tell if there's something common among them?
  \begin{myenum}
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/3$. 
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/5$. 
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/7$.
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/11$.
    \item Do you notice something special about the above cases?
      How many elements have multiplicative inverse?
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/6$.
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/10$. 
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/14$. 
    \item Compute the multiplicative inverses of elements in $\Z/15$. 
    \item In the above 4 cases is there something special about values which are invertible?
      Don't see the pattern? In the above, the modulus are all products of two distinct primes.
  \end{myenum}
