We'll prove (a) by mathematical induction.
(We'll prove (b) later.)
So let's form our $P(n)$.
Let $b$ be fixed.
Let $P(n)$ be the statement:
\[
P(n): \text{There are integer $q,r$ such that $n = bq + r$, $0 \leq r < b$}
\]
(I'm thinking of the original $a$ as a variable in the $P(n)$.)

The base case is easy: If $n = 0$, then if we set $q = 0$ and $r = 0$, then we do have
\[
0 = b \cdot 0 + 0, \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq 0 < b
\]
Hence $P(0)$ holds.

Now for the inductive case. 
Assume that $P(n)$ holds.
Now we consider the statement $P(n+1)$.
Note that $P(n)$ is true. Therefore there are integers $q,r$ satisfying
\[
n = bq + r, \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r < b 
\]
Therefore
\[
n + 1 = bq + r + 1
\]
Either $r = b - 1$ or $r < b - 1$.
(Note that $r$ cannot be greater than $b - 1$ since $r < b$.)

\underline{\textsc{Case}: $r = b - 1$.}
Then we have
\begin{align*}
           n     &= bq + r       \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= bq + r + 1   \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= bq + b       \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= b(q + 1)     \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= b(q + 1) + 0, 0 \leq 0 < b \\
\end{align*}
So if we set $q' = q + 1$ and $r' = 0$ we do have
\[
n + 1 = bq' + r',\,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r' < b \\
\]
In other words $P(n+1)$ holds.

\underline{\textsc{Case}: $r < b - 1$.}
Then we have
\begin{align*}
n     &= bq + r    , \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r, \,\,\,\,\, r < b - 1 \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= bq + r + 1, \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r, \,\,\,\,\, r < b - 1 \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= bq + r + 1, \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r, \,\,\,\,\, r + 1 < b \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= bq + r + 1, \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r + 1, \,\,\,\,\, r + 1 < b \\
\THEREFORE n + 1 &= bq + r + 1, \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r + 1 < b \\
\end{align*}
So if we set $q' = q$ and $r' = r + 1$, we have
\[
n + 1 = bq' + r', \,\,\,\,\, 0 \leq r' < b
\]

\underline{\textsc{Case}: $r > b - 1$.}
This case cannot occur since we have the fact that $r < b$.

Therefore in all cases, $P(n+1)$ holds.

Since $P(0)$ is true and if $P(n)$ holds,
then so does $P(n+1)$ for $n \geq 0$,
by mathematical induction, $P(n)$ must be true for all $n \geq 0$.
