  Write a function \verb!matmult! so that if \verb!M! is a 2D array of
  size 2-by-2 and \verb!v! is a column vector, i.e., a 2D array of size
  2-by-1, then \verb!matmult(M, v)! will return the product \verb!Mv!
  as described above.
  Remember to mod by 26 all the values.
  (If you know your linear algebra -- either from computer graphics CISS380
  or linear algebra math class, you can figure out how to complete
  this function for \verb!M! and \verb!v! of sizes
  $n$-by-$n$ and $n$-by-$1$ respectively)
