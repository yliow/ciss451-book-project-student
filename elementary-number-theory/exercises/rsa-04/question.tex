  Suppose Eve has $N = pq$ and $\phi(N)$, but
  not the primes $p$ and $q$.
  Design an algorithm to compute $p$ and $q$.
  [HINT: Consider the quadratic polynomial
  $(x - p)(x - q)$. The roots are $p$ and $q$.]
  Use your algorithm to compute
  $p$ and $q$ where
  $N = 968207 = pq$ and $\phi(N) = 966240$.
