  You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]

    You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is
    not allowed).
    \li Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
  \end{enumerate}
  Given an integer \verb!n!, return the minimum number of operations to get the character \verb!'A'! exactly \verb!n! times on the screen.
