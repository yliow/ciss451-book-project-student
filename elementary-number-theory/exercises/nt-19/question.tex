  Can even positive integer be written as the sum of two primes?
  When the two primes are $> 2$, then the sum of these two primes
  is even.
  The \defone{Goldbach conjecture} states that
  every positive integer can be written as the sum of two primes.
  (See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture}.)
  Write a program that prints $n \geq 2$ as a sum of two primes as $n$
  iterates from 2 to a huge positive integer $N$ entered by the user.
