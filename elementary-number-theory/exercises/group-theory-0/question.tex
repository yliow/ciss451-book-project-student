\begin{myenum}
\item The set of binary numbers (of any length) with usual
    binary number addition.
    For instance $1101 + 101 = 10010$.
    Is this a group?
  \item For $n > 0$, the set of binary numbers of length $n$ with
    columnwise mod 2 addition. The size is $2^n$.
    For instance $1101 + 0101 = 1000$.
    Is this a group?
