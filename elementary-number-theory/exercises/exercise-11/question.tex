  \item What are all the possible values of
    $x^2 \pmod{4}$?

    (Note: The key thing to note is that
    $x \pmod 4$ can take all the values 0, 1, 2, 3 mod 4.
    But the squares $x^2 \pmod 4$ can only certain values mod 4.)
    
  \item What are all the possible values of
    $x^2 \pmod{5}$?

  \item What about squares mod 7?
  
  \item What about squares mod 15? (Be efficient.)

  \item
    Prove that there are no integer solutions to
    \[
      5x^2 - 8y^2 = 3
    \]
    (HINT: Prove this by contradiction. Take mod 4 ... and ... Checkmate!)
    Without modular arithmetic, there's no clear way to
    solve this problem! Go number theory!)
