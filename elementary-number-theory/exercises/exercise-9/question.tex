  \begin{myenum}
  \item
    Can you solve
    \[
      x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{26}
    \]
    Of course one solution is $1 \pmod {26}$.
    Can you find the other one in 1 second?
    Are there just two? Or are there more than two solutions?
    These are (of course) square roots of 1, but in mod 26 and not $\R$.
  \item
    What about
    \[
      x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{26}
    \]
  \item
    Keep going ... try to solve
    \[
      x^2 \equiv a \pmod{26}
    \]
    for all cases.
    Draw a table for the square roots of $a \pmod{26}$ for all $a$'s.
