Compute the $\gcd(16, 123)$.
If it's 1, find $x$ such that $16x \equiv 1 \pmod{123}$.
Use the above version of Extended Euclidean Algorithm and compute by hand.
When you're done, write a program implementing the above algorithm
and check that it gives you the same result.
Solve the equation
\[
16x + 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{123}
\]
i.e. find an integer $x$ such that $0 \leq x < 123$ satisfying the
above congruence.
