Continuing the previous exercise ...
  \begin{myenum}
  \item
    Next, try to solve 
    \[
      x^2 \equiv a \pmod{N}
    \]
    for all $a \pmod{N}$ for at least 3 values of $N$.
    See any patterns? 
  \item
    The above is probably too tough.
    What if you try
    \[
      x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{p}
    \]
    for primes $p$? Try a few primes (maybe 20-30) and make a table. Notice a pattern?
  \end{myenum}
