  (Also, Die Hard 3 problem
  \url{https://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/hollywood/diehard/diehard.htm}.)
  You are given two jugs with capacities \verb!jug1Capacity! and
  \verb!jug2Capacity! liters.
  There is an infinite amount of water supply available.
  Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly \verb!targetCapacity!
  liter using these two jugs.

  If \verb!targetCapacity! liters of water are measurable,
  you must have \verb!targetCapacity! liters of water contained within one or
  both buckets by the end.

  Operations allowed:
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Fill any of the jugs with water.
    \item Empty any of the jugs.
    \item Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely
      full, or the first jug itself is empty.
  \end{enumerate}
