  Suppose you want to write a random number generator.
  Say the numbers are to be in the range [0,256).
  (You can try a bigger range later -- don't be too ambitious for now.)
  Of course use (reasonable) formula.
  \begin{myenum}
  \item Go ahead and try this one:
    \[
      h(n) = (2n + 5) \pmod{256} 
    \]
    Starting with a seed value of 1, the next value is $h(1) = 7$.
    And the value after that is $h(7) = 19$.
    And the next is $h(19) = 43$.
    What are all the possible values you can obtain using this $h$?
  \item
    Now of course you do want to have lots of values.
    For instance you might want to use this hash function
    to build a hashtable.
    Or a cryptographic hash (which we have no covered yet).
    But in any case, you hope that $h$ covers \textit{all} the values in
    $[0,255]$.
    Was the function above a good function?  
  \item
    What if you use a different seed value? What if you start with 2?
    Or 3?
  \item 
    Try to find a function that generates
    as many values in $[0,255]$ as possible.
    Can you find one that covers the whole range of $[0,255]$?
  \end{myenum}
