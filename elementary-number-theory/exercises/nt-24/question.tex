  \url{https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-arrangements/}
  Return the number of permutations of 1 to $n$ so that prime numbers are at
  prime indices (1-indexed.)
  (Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1,
  and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller
  than it.)
  Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.
