(b)
Recall the uniqueness of inverse:
if
\[
x * y = e = y * x
\]
then $y = x^{-1}$.
Replacing $x$ with $x^{-1}$ and $y$ by $x$, since
\[
x^{-1} * x = e = x * x^{-1} 
\]
I get $x = (x^{-1})^{-1}$.
All the others can be proven using the uniqueness of inverse
except that for (d) you'll also need induction.
