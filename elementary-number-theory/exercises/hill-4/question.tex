  Say the key is
  \[
  M = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      11 & 8 \\
      3 & 7 
    \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    Here $n = 2$, i.e., the block size is $2$.
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
      \item
        What is the encryption of $x = $ \verb!fortytwo!?
        Call the ciphertext $y$.
      \item What is the inverse matrix $M^{-1}$ of $M$?
        (Note: we are in mod 26.)
        Check that $MM^{-1} = I = M^{-1}M$.
      \item Decrypt your $y$ and make sure you get $x$.
      \item
        Look for the probability of 2-grams.
        Take a long enough string, encrypt it using Hill cipher
        and with the above key. Look at the probability of 2-grams
        in the ciphertext.
        Compare the two probabilities of the 2-grams from the plaintext
        and from teh cipherptext.
    \end{enumerate}
