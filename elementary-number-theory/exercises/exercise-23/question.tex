Continuing the previous question:
  \begin{myenum}
  \item
  I further claim that if the number is an 8--digit number
  $hgfedcba$, then
  \[
    hgfedcba \equiv ba + 2((-2c + 6d - 5e) + (2f - 6g + 5h)) \pmod{26}
  \]
  This is also the same as saying
  \[
    hgfedcba \equiv ba + 2((2(f-c) + 6(d-g) + 5(h-e))  \pmod{26}
  \]  
  Is this true?
  Write a program to check.
  If it's true, prove it.

  \item
  Can you conjecture a general formula?
  Can you prove it?

  \end{myenum}
