Plot a function of the graph $y = \phi(x)$ for integer values of $x$
running through $1$ to $10000$.
See any pattern? Note that if you want an approximation (for instance
in the asymptotics) that's not too difficult.
Note the following:
There are two ways to compute $\phi(n)$:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep,label=\textnormal{(\alph*)}]
\item $\phi(n) = |\{x \mid 0 \leq x < n - 1, \,\,\, \gcd(x, n) = 1\}|$
  which required Euclidean algorithm in a loop.
\item
  $\phi(n)$
  $= \phi(p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_g^{\alpha_g})$
  $= (p_1^{\alpha_1} - p_1^{\alpha_1 - 1}) \cdots (p_1^{\alpha_g} - p_1^{\alpha_g - 1})$
  which requires prime factorization.
\end{enumerate}
The first method is slow: you need to loop your $x$ and for each $x$ you need to
execute the EEA which has a loop.
The second method is fast only if you can find the prime
factorization of $n$.
Is it possible to find $\phi(n)$ as a formula in $n$ without finding the
prime factorization of $n$?
For instance the factorial function $n!$ has this interpolation:
If
\[
\Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1} e^{-t} \ dt
\]
then $\Gamma(n + 1) = n!$ for positive integers $n$.
Is there a fast interpolation of $\phi(n)$?
