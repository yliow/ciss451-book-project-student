  Why is the permutation cipher a special case of the Hill cipher?
  To try it out, write down an example of Hill cipher and
  re-interpret it as a permutation cipher.
  You'll see that the matrix has a special form -- it has only
  0s and 1s arranged in a certain way.
  Such a matrix is called a \defone{permutation matrix}.
