  \item  Solve
    \[
      3x = 1
    \]
    in $\Z$. Of course you can't! Now solve
    \[
      3x = 1
    \]
    in $\Q$. Of course you can!
    We would say that $\frac{1}{3}$ is the multiplicative
    inverse of $3$ in $\Q$.
    Also, we would say that, in $\Z$, $3$ is not invertible.
    What about
    \[
      3x \equiv 1 \pmod{26}
    \]
  Can you? If you can then you have found a multiplicative inverse of
  $3 \pmod{26}$.
  \item
    Now try to solve
    \[
      ax \equiv 1 \pmod{26}
    \]
    for $a \equiv 0, 1, 2, ..., 25 \pmod{26}$.
    Which $a$'s have multiplicative inverses?
    Is there a pattern to $a$'s with multiplicative inverses mod $26$ and who
    which do not?
  \item
    Now try
    \[
      ax \equiv 1 \pmod{N}
    \]
    where $N$ is a positive integer and $a \equiv 0, 1, 2, ..., N - 1 \pmod{N}$; say you try $N = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.
    Notice something? See a pattern?
    Is there a pattern to $a$'s with multiplicative inverses mod $26$ and who
    which do not?
