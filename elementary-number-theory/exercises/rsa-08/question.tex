  Write a function \verb!write_primes! that accepts \verb!x! and a path \verb!p!
  and store primes up to \verb!x! at path \verb!p! in comma-separated format.
  For instance \verb!write_primes(10, 'primes-10.txt')!
  writes \verb!"2,3,5,7"! to the file \verb!primes-10.txt!.
  Write another function \verb!read_primes! that accepts a path \verb!p!
  and returns a list of primes stored at path \verb!p!.
  Create a file of primes up to 10,000,000.
  After you are done with the above make a slight optimization by storing
  integer in hex.
  While a decimal (base-10 digit) can store 10 patterns,
  a hexadecimal can store 16.
  Try this:
  \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,fontsize=\footnotesize]
i = int("0x1a", 16) # the "0x" is optional
print(i)
s = hex(i)
print(s)
  \end{Verbatim}
  (It's even better to store the integer directly in binary format, but
  that makes the file non-human readable.)
