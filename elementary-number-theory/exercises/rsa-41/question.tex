  Suppose $n$ is an odd prime. 
  What will happen during the execution of Fermat's factorization algorithm with $n$ as input?
  Would the algorithm terminate? (If not, then it's not really an algorithm!)
  Can Fermat factorization algorithm be converted to a primality testing algorithm?
  Would it be possible? Would it be a good idea?
