  Implement Fermat factorization and try to optimize it as much as you can.
  (There are some questions below on optimization.)
  Test for many values of $n$.
  Make a plot.
  What is the runtime of Fermat factorization algorithm based on your experiment?
  You don't have to completely factorize $n$.
  Finding a factor is good enough.
  Can you get roughly $O(n^{1/2})$? $O(n^{1/3})$? $O(n^{1/4})$?
