  Leetcode 1622.\\
  \url{https://leetcode.com/problems/fancy-sequence/description/}\\
  Write an API that generates fancy sequences using the
  \texttt{append}, \texttt{addAll}, and \texttt{multAll} operations.
  Implement the \texttt{Fancy} class:
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \li \texttt{Fancy()} Initializes the object with an empty sequence.
    \li \texttt{void append(val)}
    Appends an integer \texttt{val} to the end of the sequence.
    \li \texttt{void addAll(inc)}
    Increments all existing values in the sequence by an integer \texttt{inc}.
    \li \texttt{void multAll(m)}
    Multiplies all existing values in the sequence by an integer \texttt{m}.
    \li \texttt{int getIndex(idx)}
    Gets the current value at index \texttt{idx} ($0$-indexed)
    of the sequence modulo $109 + 7$.
    If the index is greater or equal than the length of the sequence,
    return $-1$.
\end{enumerate}
