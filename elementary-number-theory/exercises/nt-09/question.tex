  \\
  Given an integer array \verb!nums! and an integer \verb!k!,
  return the number of subarrays of \verb!nums! where the greatest common
  divisor
  of the subarray's elements is \verb!k!.
  A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
  The greatest common divisor of an array is the largest integer that evenly
  divides all the array elements.
